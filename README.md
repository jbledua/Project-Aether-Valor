# Project-Aether-Valor

## Introduction
Welcome to "Project-Aether-Valor," a dedicated sub-project of "Project Aether: The Aether Trials," focused on the creation and continuous enhancement of character models. Here, we delve into the artistry and technical craftsmanship of bringing our heroes to life. Our mission is to sculpt the valorous figures that players will embody as they navigate through the elemental challenges of The Aether Trials.

## Objectives
- **Design and Refine:** Craft detailed and engaging character models that resonate with the game's thematic essence and player expectations.
- **Animation and Rigging:** Ensure each character model is not only visually compelling but also fully functional within the game's dynamic environment.
- **Feedback and Iteration:** Continuously refine character models based on community feedback and gameplay developments.

## How to Contribute
We encourage collaboration and contributions from artists, animators, and developers. Whether you have ideas for new character designs, technical skills in 3D modeling, or feedback on existing models, your input is invaluable. Please see our contribution guidelines for more information on how to get involved.
